# Raw Idea: Core tdom Integration Hooks

**Feature #1 from Product Roadmap**

## Description

Implement optional `config` and `context` parameters in tdom's `html()` function
- Design pluggable component location interface
- Design pluggable component instantiation interface
- Pass context through component lifecycle in processor
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing tdom usage

## Purpose

This is the foundation feature that enables all dependency injection capabilities by adding minimal, upstreamable changes to the tdom core library.
